and lanecron swam... and continue swimming...
until his stomachs couldn't handle it anymore.
Hurted?.... ofended
(by the gay bear who followed him everywhere)
Five arrows in the forehead. and fiveMHHHH. nothing to eat.....
Lanecron swam... and swam with his rose
and his four fucking torches.
until trying to find an island somewhere
but everything he found was water and disappointment
The water tu.. began to turn to a darker colour for some fucking reason
But far away... he saw hope...
something that maybe... would mean the start of a new life
"Is that far away thing and island?"
said lanecron
while he looked and didn't find anything
but when he looked at a side he saw an island so there is an island there really.
so..
with his heart broken but with his soul still strong
he continued swimming 
he ate the rose *sound of eating rose*

GET AWAY SEAGULL, SON OF A BITCH DON'T EAT ME
